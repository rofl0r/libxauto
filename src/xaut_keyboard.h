 *
 * <li>The braces {} signify a special key code.  The code contained
 * inside must correspond to a X11 key symbol name string.  The brace
 * can also contain a number, which indicates the number of times to
 * press the key.  E.g. {Tab} presses the tab key.  {Tab 3} presses
 * the tab key three times.  Use print_keycodes() to get a listing
 * of valid keycodes.  You will want to use a value from the
 * column called <em>X11 key symbol name string</em>.  The symbols
 * are case sensitive - they must match what is printed <em>exactly</em>.</li>
 *
 * <li>Note that all valid X11 codes are valid inside braces.</li>
 *
 * <li>The exclamation point (!) signifies press the alt key for the next
 * letter.  So type( "!a" ) would press the alt key down, then press
 * and release the a key, and then finally release the alt key.  Use
 * {exclam} to send the literal exclamation point.</li>
 *
 * <li>The plus sign (+) signifies press the shift key for the next
 * letter - similar to alt.  So type( "+a" ) would press down
 * the shift key down, press and release the a key, and then finally release
 * the shift key.</li>
 *
 * <li>The carat - or circumflex - (^) signifies press the control key
 * for the next letter - similar to shift and alt.  So type( "^a" ) would
 * press the control key, then press and release the a key, and then finally
 * release the control key.</li>
 *
 * <li>The number sign - or pound symbol - (#) signifies press the meta key
 * for the next letter - similar to shift, control, and alt.  So type( "#a" )
 * would press the meta key, then press and release the a key, and then finally
 * release the meta key.  Note that the "meta" key is sometimes named after
 * a certain software company :)</li>
 *
 * <li>The previous special keys can be combined.  So type( "+^#!a" ) would
 * press and hold down the shift, control, meta, and alt keys, press and release the
 * a, and then release the alt, meta, control, and shift keys.</li>
 *
 * <li>Use the string name for a key if you wish to send a literal !, +, or ^.
 * E.g. {exclam}{plus}{asciicircum} would send !+^ .</li>
 *
 * <li>Sending upper case letters as well as many symbols actually cause a
 * shift and letter/symbol, e.g. A and +a are the same.  For this reason,
 * one should use lower case letters in combination with control keys
 * to avoid confusion.  ^a is not the same as ^A - ^A is precisely
 * the same as ^+a .</li>
 *
 * <li>Invalid characters encountered (if any) are printed to the error
 * stream and then ignored.</li>
 *
 * <li>Modifier keys (alt, control, and shift) are released after each
 * keycode in a brace, and after the next letter when not in a brace.
 * If you wish to use multiple letters in combination with modifier keys,
 * you'll need to construct the correct sequence yourself using the
