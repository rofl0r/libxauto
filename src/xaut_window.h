 * there are fewer windows to test, but has the disadvantage that
 * there are many "windows" that the window manager does not "manage".
 * For example the volumn control in the task tray is managed by
 * X but is not managed by e.g. KDM.  Use this function if you
 * are interested only in traditional "window" objects,
 * otherwise try "search_for_window".
 *
 * The following criteria is used when multiple windows match:
 * First the distance from the user's current window is considered.
 * If one window is "closer" than another it is immediately selected.
 * If not, then the window with the lower ID is returned.  This usually -

 * the volumn control cannot - but it can most likely can be found via
