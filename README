Note: this is forked from http://sourceforge.net/projects/xautomation

i basically removed the python dependency and the autoconf stuff that wouldn't 
compile on my machine, and adapted the makefile.

Original Readme starts after this line.

=== Preamble ===
This software is intended to help users of XWindows automate basic windowing
tasks.  For example you can open, move, and close windows based on title,
you can move the mouse, or send keystrokes.

I provide this software free of charge without warranty of any type.  I
provide this in the hopes that it will be useful.  In the event you break
this software, you are entitled to a full refund of the amount I charged. :)


=== My Rationale ===
There are a few X11 control libraries out there.  My basic problem with
most of them  are that they are all called from the bash prompt.  This is fine,
but it makes it difficult to do things like track window state.  At each call
to the program, window information is gathered again, and the request is
processed.


=== What you'll need to compile this ===
Note that Ubuntu (along with some other distributions of Linux) do not come
with a development environment installed.  You'll need to install a development
environment if you do not already have one.

Libraries:
 -- x11proto-xext-dev
 -- libx11-dev
 -- libxtst-dev


=== What you'll need to run this ===

To run this software - like say for example you compile it on one machine, and
then transport the binary to another machine - make sure you have the following
libraries installed:
 -- libx11-dev
 -- libxtst-dev
