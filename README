=== PREAMBLE
This software is intended to help users of XWindows automate basic windowing
tasks.  For example you can open, move, and close windows based on title,
you can move the mouse, or send keystrokes.

I provide this software free of charge without warranty of any type.  I
provide this in the hopes that it will be useful.  In the event you break
this software, you are entitled to a full refund of the amount I charged. :)
